# infosec-tools
I plan to publish some infosec tools that I am using myself on Pentests and Bug Bounties, that might be useful for Penetration testers, red teamers and bug bounty hunters here.


# Disclaimer
Unauthorized use of these tools can damage websites, which makes you a criminal.
Never use them in any work you are not authorized to do.
Otherwise, any damage you may cause to the systems is entirely at your own risk.

My aim in sharing the tools is to enable those working in the cyber security sector and those interested in the sector to improve themselves within the legal framework and to make some standard procedures and tests easier.

For now, I only plan to publish a few tools, but maybe in the future I can turn this place into a lush green area, I don't know.
